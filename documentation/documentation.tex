\subsection{Competency Questions}
\label{ssec:cqs}
%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}[\phantom{CQ }CQ 1.]
	\item Where are the places where heat is rising and migration is occurring that cannot be explained by urbanization?
	\item Are there areas in other states than California that are frequently affected by wildfires?
	\item Which farm has experienced disease?
	\item Which residents are still evacuated from the same region where the second hurricane hit?
	\item Given fire x, which regions will be effected by smoke exposure, given current wind direction projections?
	\item What were wildfires affecting the Ventura area in the 2010s?
	\item What factors can you find in a specific region that would help explain e.g. the stroke belt. Which contaminants of farms may be related from the health literature to strokes?
	\item where to deliver Covid-19 supplies?
	\item Was the Cholera outbreak in Mozambique contributing to the food shortage in year x?
	\item Which farm has adopted health soil practice after other nearby farms did so?
	\item What were the reasons for the landslide east of Santa Barbara in April 2017?
	\item Where are areas of increased heat exceedance and pollution, where migration is not driven by urbanization?
	\item If I am an agent of an insurance company, what information I can gain from your KWG? (not a competency question, but may help us to think)
	\item Which farm has High productivity and low connectivity?
	\item Which region affected by a transmissive disease is affected by a hurricane?
	\item Which region affected by the current hurricane just suffers from another natural disaster?
	\item How were the 2019 Southern California fires affecting the tourism industry?
	\item Which regions affected by wildfires are expected to experience heavy rain (flood risk)
	\item What farmlands or vegetation covers have been mostly affected in the fire?
	\item What are the causalities of the wildfire? To answer it, we need spatiotemporal information of temperature, precipitation, soil moisture and etc. in the KG.

\subsection{Use Cases}
\label{ssec:use-cases}
%%%%%%%%%%
These are the usecases!

\subsubsection{Thomas Fire}
Thunderstorm in Ventura County results in Wildfire in Ventura County
Wildfire in Ventura County results in low air quality in Santa Barbara
Low air quality in Santa Barbara results in evacuations in Santa Barbara

\subsubsection{Direct Relief}
Hurricanes happen in Mozambique; Hurricanes disrupt sewer systems; Cholera is endemic to sub-Saharan region; Mozambique is in Sub-Saharan region; disrupted sewer systems lead to Cholera outbreaks; "this" Hurricane disrupted sewer systems in Mozambique; there were recent outbreaks of Cholera in Mozambique; Mozambique is experiencing a Cholera outbreak due to "this" Hurricane; Cholera outbreaks lead to Vaccination programs
