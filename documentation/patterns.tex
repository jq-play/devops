We list the individual modules of the ontology, together with their axioms and explanations thereof. Each axiom is listed only once (for now), i.e. some axioms pertaining to a module may be found in the axiom set listed for an earlier listed module. Schema diagrams are provided throughout, but the reader should keep in mind that while schema diagrams are very useful for understanding an ontology \cite{odp-documentation}, they are also inherently ambiguous.
